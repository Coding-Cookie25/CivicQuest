🏙️ CivicQuest — Gamified Civic Engagement Platform
🚀 A Flask-based web app that empowers citizens to report civic issues, engage through mini-games, and earn leaderboard points — merging technology with community awareness.
🧠 About the Project

CivicQuest is a web application designed to make civic participation engaging and rewarding.
Users can report issues (like potholes, broken lights, or illegal dumping), play awareness-based mini-games, and view their ranking on a community leaderboard — turning civic responsibility into an interactive digital experience.

The app is built using Python (Flask) for backend APIs, HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and SQLite for local data storage.

🎯 Key Features

✅ User Authentication:

Secure signup and login using Flask sessions and password hashing (Flask-Bcrypt).

✅ Issue Reporting System:

Users can report civic issues with type, location, description, and optional photo.

Each report is stored in SQLite and displayed in a real-time issue feed.

✅ Gamification:

Users earn points for reporting issues or completing awareness activities.

A leaderboard ranks top contributors by score.

✅ Mini-Games & Quizzes:

Includes a “Clean-Up” drag-and-drop game and a civic awareness quiz.

Encourages environmental responsibility and local engagement.

✅ Responsive Frontend:

Designed with Tailwind CSS and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic behavior and mobile compatibility.

✅ RESTful API Architecture:

Flask provides modular endpoints for login, signup, issue reporting, and leaderboard updates.

✅ Data Persistence:

All data (users, issues, scores) is stored in an SQLite database (civicquest.db).
